/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding - the value of "this" will be in the window object.
* 2. Implicit Binding - when a function is called by a dot, the object left of the dot gets "this".
* 3. New Binding - when a constructor function is used, "this" refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
* 4. Explicit Binding - when Javascript's call or apply method is used, "this" is explicitly defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
